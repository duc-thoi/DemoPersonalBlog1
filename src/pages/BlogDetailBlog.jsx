                A grid system is a design tool used to arrange content on a
                webpage. It is a series of vertical and horizontal lines that
                create a matrix of intersecting points, which can be used to
                align and organize page elements. Grid systems are used to
                create a consistent look and feel across a website, and can help
                to make the layout more visually appealing and easier to
                navigate.

                If youâ€™ve been to New York City and have walked the streets, it
                is easy to figure out how to get from one place to another
                because of the grid system that the city is built on. Just as
                the predictability of a city grid helps locals and tourists get
                around easily, so do webpage grids provide a structure that
                guides users and designers alike. Because of their consistent
                reference point, grids improve page readability and scannability
                and allow people to quickly get where they need to go.

                There are three common grid types used in websites and
                interfaces: column grid, modular grid, and hierarchical grid.
              </div>
              <div className="supporting-text1">
                Column grid involves dividing a page into vertical columns. UI
                elements and content are then aligned to these columns.
              </div>
              <div className="supporting-text1">
                Modular grid extends the column grid further by adding rows to
                it. This intersection of columns and rows make up modules to
                which elements and content are aligned. Modular grids are great
                for ecommerce and listing pages, as rows are repeatable to
                accommodate browsing.
              </div>
              <div className="supporting-text1">
                Hierarchical grid: Content is organized by importance using
                columns, rows, and modules. The most important elements and
                pieces of content take up the biggest pieces of the grid.

              <b className="supporting-text9">Breaking Down the Grid</b>
              <div className="supporting-text1">
                Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made
                up of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.

                <span>
                  Columns take up most of the real estate in a grid. Elements
                  and content are placed in columns. To adapt to any screen
                  size, column widths are generally defined with percentages
                  rather than fixed values and the number of columns will vary.
                  For example, a grid on a mobile device might have 4 columns
                  and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.

                  The gutter is the space between columns that separates
                  elements and content from different columns. Gutter widths are
                  fixed values but can change based on different breakpoints.
                  For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens,
                  whereas smaller gutters are appropriate for smaller screens
                  like mobile.

                will see that some product images settle to the margins, while

                to focus or quickly scan product images and calls more attention

                  Take time to think through what type of grid Â­â€” column,
                  modular, or hierarchical â€” best suits your needs. A
                  hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page
                  will always be more important than the surrounding elements.
                  For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news
                  platforms. If the content you need to display is highly
                  variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as
                  these provide lots of flexibility when designing. For example,
                  elements and content can span across multiple columns or
                  modules or just one to fit design needs.

                  Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well for
                  your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number of
                  columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your
                  screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile,
                  tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or
                  desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design
                  needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size
                  decreases. Wireframing tools like Sketch and Figma have quick
                  and easy ways to set up and edit your grid, even after you
                  have started designing.

                  The gutters should remain empty as you place elements on the
                  grid in order to clearly separate and align content and
                  elements.

                  For most common devices, the screen size in pixels is a
                  multiple of 8. Keeping grid-component values at a multiple of
                  8 will generally make it easier to scale and implement a grid.

                Grids not only provide designers a structure on which to base
                layouts, but they also improve readability and scannability for
                end users. Use a good grid system that easily adapts to various
                screen sizes.
